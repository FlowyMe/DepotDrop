218 piyo2lg7arxizwmy4juekmwb Stone Vessel Sink in Honed Basalt Black Granite with Waterfall Faucet and Pop-Up Drain in Antique Bronze This honed, basalt-black basin presents a very low profile featuring a slightly-wide, rectangular shape and a subtle bowing upward to its raised corners.

With an overall measurement of 18-1/2 in. x 14-3/4 in. x 5 in., it will require a minimum-width cabinet of 21 in. The waterfall faucet features fully-tested, superior-quality, solid-brass components.
